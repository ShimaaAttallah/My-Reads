# My-Reads

Final Project For Udacity's React Development - Cross-skilling Track

# Project Overview

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

Currently Reading,
Want to Read,
Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books.
